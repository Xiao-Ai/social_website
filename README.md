# Graduation dissertation and project

What is this:
This is a job hunting and social networking website, which is mainly designed for college students to find jobs and get socially connected as well.

Background Story:
People are prone to entertain themselves on the social networking website. In business and employment field, however, social networking seems rarely be involved in it. Whatâ€™s more, many students in my school, especially those who are graduating, are having a hard time finding suitable jobs. Since a campus itself is a huge network, so if the popularity of social networking and the eager for job hunting of students could be considered together to form a systematic job and social networking website, then the pressure of finding jobs would be alleviated effectively.
